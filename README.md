FGrS: Fast Gravimetric Spherical Harmonic Synthesis Software
Overview
FGrS is an open-source software package for efficient computation of Earth gravity field functionals using global gravity models (GGMs).
It addresses computational challenges in harmonic synthesis for ultra-high degree global gravity models.

Key Features
Computes major Earth gravity quantities:
Gravitational potential
Gravity disturbance/anomaly
Height anomaly
Geoid
Potential derivatives up to second order
Supports computation on:
